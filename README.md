# bank_churn_modeling
Exploring and analyzing factors influencing customer churn in banking institutions and building predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning.

Using banking data provided by https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbadole/bank-customer-churn-prediction-dataset/data

This program (main.py) explores the information in the csv file (Churn_Modeling.csv) to create a model that visualizes and predicts the correlation between features.
Using pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and seaborn to extract and visualize the data, the program then trains the model using scikit-learn and imbalanced-learn to predict correlation between the different features through multiple classifiers, such as logistic regression, support vector machine, k nearest neighbor, xgboost, adaboost, and decision tree methods.

Future Improvements:
A new dataset with more values and features could yield better results, accounting for a more balanced dataset
